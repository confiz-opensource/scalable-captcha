  Note: The basic inspiration came from ScalableCaptcha (http://expressica.com/scalable_captcha/)
        but we ran into major scalability issues so decided to develop our own.

  Introduction:
  -------------
  ScalableCaptcha is a simple, highly scalable and a robust captcha plugin. It's implementation requires a
  simple setup script and followed by adding up a single line in views and in controllers.
  
  Unlike others of it's kind ScalableCaptcha is highly scalable (duh!) and independent of
  external service.

  ScalableCaptcha is available to be used with Rails2.0 or above and also it provides the
  backward compatibility with previous versions of Rails.

  Features:
  -----------
  -> numerous options for image style, distortion, noise and code type.
  -> pre-generates captcha images hence is highly scalable.


Pre-Requisite
=========================================================================================
  -> rmagick
  -> rails 2.x.x
  -> 1.8.x

Installation
=========================================================================================
  >> ruby script/plugin install https://github.com/confiz/scalable-captcha

Setup
=========================================================================================
  After installation, follow these simple steps to setup the plugin. The setup will depend
  on the version of rails your application is using.

  Step 1
    for rails >= 2.0
        rake scalable_captcha:setup

    for rails < 2.0
        rake scalable_captcha:setup_old

  Step 2
    rake db:migrate
    rake scalable_captcha:generate_images

    Note: if you want to customize the images generated update scalable_captcha.yml
          and run rake scalable_captcha:generate_images

  Step 3
    ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
      map.scalable_captcha '/scalable_captcha/:action', :controller => 'scalable_captcha'
    end

  Step 4
    ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      include ScalableCaptcha::ControllerHelpers
    end


Examples
===========================================================================================

    In the view file within the form tags add this code
        <%= show_scalable_captcha %>

    and in the controllerâ€™s action authenticate it as

    def my_action
      if scalable_captcha_valid?
        do_this
      else
        do_that
      end
    end

    Note: look into scalable_captcha.yml for details on image style, distortion and code type.
